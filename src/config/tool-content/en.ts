      <p>PDF Vector Extractor unlocks vector paths and artwork embedded inside PDF files. Easily extract vector charts, diagrams, or logos from documents for design work or printing.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, it utilizes high-fidelity SVG rendering to deconstruct PDF vector paths into clean, standard SVG element trees without loss of precision.</p>
      <p>The interface highlights hover elements with a Z-axis 3D layer explosion effect, complete with a color picker panel for designers to adjust and extract vector nodes.</p>
